# EEPROMProgrammer
Simple Arduino code to program EEPROMs for a simple 8-bit breadboard computer project

* Can program a 7 segment display to render a 3 digit (plus leading sign) number from an 8-bit binary number (in both signed and unsigned mode). This part borrowed / copied heavily from Ben Eater's work.
* Can also use this to program microcode for driving the control lines.
* Can also write assembly language programs for "pre-canned" programs, which can be loaded into RAM for execution (via "load" mode).

In general, see src for documentation.
