# EEPROMProgrammer
Simple Arduino code to program EEPROMs for a simple 8-bit breadboard computer project

* Can program a 7 segment display to render a 3 digit (plus leading sign) number from an 8-bit binary number (in both signed and unsigned mode). This part borrowed / copied heavily from Ben Eater's work.
* Can also use this to program microcode control line EEPROMs
* TODO: program in assembly for a bunch of "pre-canned" programs, assuming we build logic to load that into RAM to then execute

# 7 segment display programmer
TODO: any documentation here not in the code?

# Microcode programmer
See code for documentation
